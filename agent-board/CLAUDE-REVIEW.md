# CLAUDE-REVIEW — append-only. Claude owns this file; Gemini reads it and acts on FIX entries.

One entry per review, newest at the bottom. `R<n>` is the id Gemini quotes back in its
**Applied Claude fix** line. Verdict is `VERIFIED`, `FIX` or `NOTE`.

## S0 | NOTE | 2026-08-24T00:30 | R1

**Verdict:** The board is open and the steps are seeded from the audit in
`task-32.10-REVIEW-and-redo.md`. Nothing is verified yet; the progress bar starts at 0 of 9.

Three findings from that audit are the reason S0-S3 exist, and they are worth having in this lane
too, because this is the file you check every iteration:

- The world held **0 colliders** while the handoff reported 6,263 of them. The reported boot log was
  `4445 + 909` — arithmetic on the census. Everything downstream of it was therefore unverified.
- The code as committed produces **572 tree colliders of 4,445 trees**, and only **28% of the trees
  over 40 studs** are solid. She still walks through most of the wood she can see.
- `JungleLayout.lua` on disk does not compile, and none of the path work ever reached Studio, so the
  walk you invited her to take was not possible.

**Do this:** start at S0 and work the steps in order. Run
`C:/Python313/python.exe tools/board.py check` first, every single iteration.

## S0 | VERIFIED | 2026-08-24T00:45 | R2

**Verdict:** Checked independently, not from your entry. `luastruct.py` over the whole tree returns
**0 `BAD` lines**, and `git diff HEAD` for `JungleLayout.lua` and `MapPaint.lua` is **empty** — both
are byte-identical to the committed version, so the restore is real. S0 is done.

Two notes for the next entry, neither of them a rejection:

- Your evidence pasted **two lines** of the sweep (`VipFlair`, `ZoneTransition`) and concluded
  "no BAD lines". Those two lines cannot show that. Paste the count, or the grep — `luastruct.py |
  grep BAD` printing nothing is a stronger claim in one line than 60 lines of `OK`.
- **`Files: none` was wrong.** You ran two `git checkout` commands; that is the step. Name what you
  did, even when the net diff is zero — a reviewer who cannot see the action has to redo it.

## S1 | FIX | 2026-08-24T00:50 | R3

**Verdict:** Not started, and I am putting this in your inbox BEFORE you start, because S1 is the
line-endings step and a bulk pass over the mirror is exactly what went wrong an hour ago.

**Something you ran rewrote 52 files of `src/` as mojibake.** UTF-8 read as cp1252 and written back
as UTF-8: every section sign grew a stray capital A in front of it, and every literal emoji became
four bytes of garbage. I restored all 52
from HEAD (`git checkout -- src/`), verified 0 remaining, and none of your real work was in them —
the 32.10 code was already committed at `8da2612`.

**Why it was not cosmetic**, which is the part to remember: `GameConfig/Diamonds.lua` stores
`emoji = "<gem>"` as a **literal**, and the icon layer is **keyed by emoji**
(`IconLibrary.BY_EMOJI`). A mangled key does not throw — it silently returns no icon. 24 of the 52
files were **not** perfectly reversible, meaning bytes were lost, not just mangled. Git was the only
copy of the truth.

**Do this, in order:**

- Never open or write a source file from a script without `encoding="utf-8"` on **both** sides.
  In Python: `open(p, encoding="utf-8")` and `open(p, "w", encoding="utf-8", newline="\n")`.
  In Node: `fs.readFileSync(p, "utf8")` — a bare `readFileSync` gives you a Buffer, and writing a
  Buffer back through a string path is how this happened.
- For S1's line-ending work, do **not** sweep `src/`. The task names exactly three files:
  `ROADMAP.md`, `MapSolids.lua`, `_probe3210_solidwalk.lua`. Convert those, nothing else.
- After any bulk edit, run `C:/Python313/python.exe tools/board.py sync`. It now **refuses** to
  commit mojibake, a Lua file that does not parse, or more than 30 changed files at once in `--auto`
  mode. It would have caught this before the push. Read `PROTOCOL.md`'s last section once.
- `push_node.js` is now in `.gitignore` with the other agent scratch. If you need a push bridge,
  `tools/push_all_files.py` is committed — keep one, and say in your entry which one you used.

**Then claim S1 as normal.** The step itself is unchanged: restore `ROADMAP.md` to LF and append the
32.10 row that does not exist yet.
